Hi, I'm Ryan Delaney and I'm currently a third year computer science student at the University of St Andrews. My account contains a collection of hobby projects and contributions from the past few years.

## ðŸ”­ Current Work

My current work is focussed on my contributions to the University of St Andrews Students Association Ents Crew organisation which I manage, we are currently working to develop an event management and organisation system nicknamed uems. Check it out in the early stages at [ents-crew/uems-hub](https://github.com/ents-crew/uems-hub). As of 12 Jan, this is a near 27'000 line system built on React and Typescript.

## ðŸŒ± Learning

I'm currently learning React as part of the UEMS system (my efforts at [ents-crew/uems-frontend-themis](https://github.com/ents-crew/uems-frontend-themis)). The majority of my work is done in Typescript with Node.
