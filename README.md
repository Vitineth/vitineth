Hi, I'm Ryan Delaney and I'm currently a software engineer working at HubSpot after graduating from the University of St Andrews in 2023. My account contains a collection of hobby projects and contributions from the past few years.

## ðŸ”­ Current Work

Currently, a lot of my work is focussed at my job (unsurprisingly) where I work in observability and reliability through metrics and alerting. However my most recent projects include [harv](https://github.com/vitineth/harv) which provides a simple CLI for viewing HAR files from the command line; and [nqk](https://github.com/vitineth/nqk) which provides a simple wrapper around docker-compose that handles my bind mounts for me, port management and nginx bindings on my local network. Prior to this, my work was focussed on my contributions to the University of St Andrews Students Association Ents Crew organisation which I managed, trying to develop an event management and organisation system nicknamed uems. Check it out in the early stages at [ents-crew/uems-hub](https://github.com/ents-crew/uems-hub). As of 12 Jan, this is a near 27'000 line system built on React and Typescript. This has currently been put on hold but is hoped to be revisited in the future. 

## ðŸŒ± Learning

My language of choice tends to migrate between Java, Typescript and more recently Golang for quick system utilities. I'm always looking for more new things to learn, most recently diving into prometheus and large scale data processing pipelines.
